                <p>
                    Content creator decks are featured on the frontpage.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The description content is long enough and well written. The more detailed the better.</li>
                    <li>It is of newer date, we look at Created date and not last updated date.</li>
                    <li>We take the 160 first characters of the description and display it on the frontpage, it is important that this is well written.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Follow these bulletpoints and chances are high you will be put on the frontpage. We want to feature everything from in-meta writeups and your crazy brews as long as the content is good.

                <b>How does the ordering in the Deck Hub work?</b>
                <p>
                    The default ordering of decks is a combination of location and whether event cards have been included or not. Decks that contains event cards have shipping priority over others.

                <p>
                    To avoid these mistakes it is a good idea to leave your deck unlocked until you are sure that its is ready for print. We will let you unlock it and modify it only once but you will be able to get only one deck.
